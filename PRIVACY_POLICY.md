# Cheek App Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-09-16

Cheek App ("we", "our", or "us") provides AI-driven face analysis features. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our mobile and web applications (the "Service").

## Information We Collect

- Camera Images: When you capture or upload a photo, we process the image to perform AI analysis.
- Account Data: Your email address and authentication identifiers provided via Supabase Auth.
- Usage Data: Non-identifying app interactions and diagnostics (e.g., request timestamps, device/platform info).

## How We Use Information

- Provide the AI analysis features (e.g., processing uploaded photos to generate results).
- Maintain user accounts, subscription status, and usage limits.
- Improve app performance and reliability.

## Image Processing & Storage

- Images are uploaded to Supabase Storage to generate a temporary URL for analysis.
- Images are deleted after analysis completes. We do not retain your original images.
- Analysis results (scores/metrics) may be stored in our Supabase database linked to your account so you can review progress over time.

## Data Sharing

- We do not sell your personal information.
- We do not share your personal information with third parties except as necessary to operate our Service (e.g., Supabase as a backend service provider) or as required by law.

## Data Security

- All data is transmitted over HTTPS/TLS.
- Access to your data is restricted by authentication and authorization controls via Supabase Auth.

## Your Choices

- You can request deletion of your account and associated data by contacting us at the email below.
- You can revoke camera access in your device settings; however, this will disable camera-based features.

## Childrenâ€™s Privacy

- Our Service is not directed to children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child provided us personal information, contact us and we will take appropriate action.

## Contact Us

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated policy within the app and update the "Last updated" date above.
